I will research the possible inputs for my Automatic braking system. I will research any component that can either detect motion or light. This will be important for my circuit to be able to comprehend oncoming vehicles and such. I will also research how my circuit will function and what process I will use. Components like 555 timers and D-type flip flops to determine the output of my system (the brakes). Also look at microcontrollers to see what I could use to control what the circuit thinks of danger or not to activate the system. I will also research the possible outputs.
