My aim for this circuit was to build a prototype automatic braking system. When my cousin is driving carefully through the slow and thing country roads; the ultrasonic sensor is measuring the distance between the car and the proximity (potential dangers). When dangerously close the servo is a brake mechanism stopping the car and a red LED is activated to warn her, this prevents him from crashing. 
My circuit is built In such a way that it can follow such criteria and successfully decrease the likelihood of crashing.
If I were to reproduce my circuit, I would take more time to better research my Ultrasonic sensor so that programming it wouldnâ€™t take as long. I would also add that buzzer in or perhaps even include it as an optional purchase / upgrade. 
I could have maybe added an LCD screen to show the exact distance between the object and the sensor. As this could then be displayed on the dashboard and provide a more user friendly and realistic experience whilst driving. Or maybe change the ranges to being larger as a driver may need a larger time window to be able to react before the automatic system kicks in. 
The Ultrasonic sensor is able to create an appropriate signal by recording how long it takes for waves to come back to it and alter the state of the ECHO pin. This is then used to calculate distance and then this signal is sent to the first PIC where it is compared against reference values to be able to decide which pinout to turn high and control the logic. The logic then manipulates the signal to turn on the suitable LED. If the signal travels to the red LED then it will also trigger the second PIC and the PIC then turns on the Servo and rotates it 180 degrees. Then it turns back to its original position (unlocking the brake once out of danger) allowing for the driver to move on.
